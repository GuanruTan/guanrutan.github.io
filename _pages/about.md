I am a second-year electronic information Ph.D. candidate at The Hunan University, fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Liu from [School of Robotics](https://robotics.hnu.edu.cn/). I am also fortunate to cooperate closely with many other excellent researchers, including [Prof. Teng Zhou](http://zhouteng.net/) from Hainan University, [Zhuang Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l7wxjVwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from Shandong University, and Prof. Peng Wang from XXXX.

The primary goal of my research is to develop effective and practical models for spatio-temporal data mining. Specifically, I am interested in data-driven trajectory prediction, intention recognition and their applications (e.g., in intelligent transportation systems). Recently, I have also been interested in multi agent systems and Generative AI (e.g., diffusion models, LLMs, etc). If you share common interests and would like to explore collaboration or simply have a discussion, feel free to contact me.
